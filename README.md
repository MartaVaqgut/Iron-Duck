## Steps to Game
1. We have two players who are hunters (blue & red).
2. Player 1 is blue and moves with the arrows and fires with the shift.
3. Player 2 is red and moves with the keys (a, s, d, w) and shoots with the R key.
4. The duck is an object that is painted on the canvas and has a position and speed.
5. Hunters must collide with the duck to get score on the counter.
6. Win the one that scores the most in 3 minutes.
7. When a player reaches 10 in the hunter, the Game Over alert comes out !!
